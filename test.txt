Other tests were performed using a send buffer size of 1464 bytes, the options -t(unlimited number of packets) and -f(don't fragment flag). As far as google.com is concerned, the statistics collected with don't fragment flag are 0% loss (104 packets transmitted), RTT max 104ms, min 21ms and average 34ms, while the statistics collected without don't fragment flag are 0.8% loss(121 packets transmitted), RTT max 150ms, min 21ms and average 54ms.  As far as youtube.com is concerned, the statistics collected with don't fragment flag are 0% loss (94 packets transmitted), RTT max 129ms, min 21ms and average 52ms, while the statistics collected without don't fragment flag are 0% loss(110 packets transmitted), RTT max 129ms, min 20ms and average 37ms. In any of these cases, there were both sudden picks of high latency and extended phase of high latency, but the averages are not so high because RTTs were between the minimum values and the average values most of the time.
